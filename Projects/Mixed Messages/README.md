# **Mixed Messages**

## **The Aim**
----------
The aim of this project is to create a random message generator.
The message will be made up of different quotes to always give an incorrect quote from multiple fandoms.
The project will utilize JavaScript.

My main approach to this project will be to use 3 or 4 arrays of quotes and random number generators to stitch together a message.

## **Project Plan** 

* Decide on Topic - Topic is Quotes from fictional characters **x**
* Build Arrays - Create 3 arrays, 1 for characters, 1 for the first half of a quote, 1 for the second half of a quote
* Create a random number generator to pick an element from each array
* Concatenate each element into a full quote
* Ensure that a character can never match with the right quote, and that the 2 halves of a quote never match
* Final Product - Every time the app is run, there will be two halves of a quotes associated with the wrong character.

### **Updates:**
----------------
Created 3 Arrays:
* Characters,
* Line 1,
* Line 2

These will be populated to generate a wrong, random quote from a famous fictional character.

---------------
Populated each array with 1 element.

# **Mixed Messages**

## **How to Use:**
Simply download the .zip folder, then extract the contents, open the folder you just extracted, click the Generate Quote button and off you go.

## **The Aim:**

The aim of this project is to create a random message generator.<br>
The message will be made up of different quotes to always give an incorrect quote from multiple fandoms.<br>
The project will utilize JavaScript.<br>

My main approach to this project will be to use 3 or 4 arrays of quotes and random number generators to stitch together a message.<br>

## **Project Plan:** 

* Decide on Topic - Topic is Quotes from fictional characters **X**
* Build Arrays - Create 3 arrays, 1 for characters, 1 for the first half of a quote, 1 for the second half of a quote **X**
* Create a random number generator to pick an element from each array **X**
* Concatenate each element into a full quote **X**
* Ensure that a character can never match with the right quote, and that the 2 halves of a quote never match **X**
* Final Product - Every time the app is run, there will be two halves of a quotes associated with the wrong character. **X**
* Add more quotes for more randomness 

### **Updates:**
----------------
Created 3 Arrays:
* Characters,
* Line 1,
* Line 2

These will be populated to generate a wrong, random quote from a famous fictional character.

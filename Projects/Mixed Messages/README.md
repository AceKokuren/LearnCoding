# **Mixed Messages**

## **The Aim:**

The aim of this project is to create a random message generator.<br>
The message will be made up of different quotes to always give an incorrect quote from multiple fandoms.<br>
The project will utilize JavaScript.<br>

My main approach to this project will be to use 3 or 4 arrays of quotes and random number generators to stitch together a message.<br>

## **Project Plan:** 

* Decide on Topic - Topic is Quotes from fictional characters **x**
* Build Arrays - Create 3 arrays, 1 for characters, 1 for the first half of a quote, 1 for the second half of a quote **x**
* Create a random number generator to pick an element from each array **x**
* Concatenate each element into a full quote **x**
* Ensure that a character can never match with the right quote, and that the 2 halves of a quote never match
* Final Product - Every time the app is run, there will be two halves of a quotes associated with the wrong character.

### **Updates:**
----------------
Created 3 Arrays:
* Characters,
* Line 1,
* Line 2

These will be populated to generate a wrong, random quote from a famous fictional character.

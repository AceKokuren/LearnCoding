# **Markdown**

## **What is it?**
Markdown is the process of styling and formatting text in a simpler way to using HTML.
It allows for making clear, concise documents that can be transferred easily and translated to HTML via a converter.

A good example of when to use Markdown is creating a readme.md for github, as it means you don't have to spend time learning HTML and 
    can easily edit text documents on websites like Github.

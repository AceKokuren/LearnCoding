This document will be my brain! 
Any issues I find, I will place here along with the workaround.

Resetting to previous commit locally, must use --force or -f to push to remote to revert changes:
"git push origin master -f"

To revert changes to previous commit:
"git reset SHA_No (7 letter log code)"
"git checkout HEAD file_name"
